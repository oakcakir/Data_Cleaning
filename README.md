# Data_Cleaning
# Included data and analysis script run_analysis.R takes accelerometer data 
# (Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, Version 1.0)
# from experimental subjects carrying smart phones (in the X_train.txt and X_test.txt files, 30 subjects in total) that
# were collected while the subjects were engaged in 6 different activities: walking, walking downstairs, 
# walking upstairs, standing, sitting or laying down.
# The data includes 561 different accelerometer metrics at each time point for each subject during
# each activity.  The data is combined and converted to numeric format.  A text file, data_mean.txt is created
# that contains the mean accelerometer metrics for each subject and each activity.
# The original data was collected by the researchers outlined below.
